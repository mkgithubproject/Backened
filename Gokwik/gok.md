## 🚀 GoKwik SDE-1 Backend Developer (Node.js) — Interview Process

> 📌 **Rounds**: Usually **4 rounds** (1 screening + 2 technical + 1 HM/HR)
> 📍 **Mode**: Virtual
> 🎯 **Experience Target**: 1.5–3 years
> 💰 **CTC Band**: 10–14 LPA (based on performance)

---

### ✅ Round 1: **HR / Recruiter Screening (15–20 mins)**

* Purpose: Profile match, salary expectation, and communication check.
* Common Questions:

  * “Tell me about yourself.”
  * “Walk me through your Node.js backend experience.”
  * “Why GoKwik?”
  * CTC & Notice period

> ✅ *Tip*: Highlight **backend projects**, focus on **ownership**, **scalability**, or **performance optimization**.

---

### ✅ Round 2: **DSA + Node.js Coding Round (60 mins)**

* Format: Live coding (HackerRank / CoderPad / Shared IDE)
* Difficulty: Easy–medium (LeetCode level)
* Topics:

  * Arrays, Hash Maps, Strings, Stack, Recursion
  * JavaScript/Node-specific coding:

    * Custom promise implementation
    * Throttle/Debounce
    * Rate Limiter using in-memory store

**Example Questions**:

* Implement a cache with TTL
* Find longest substring with no repeating characters
* Implement a simple middleware chain like Express

> ✅ *Tip*: Focus on:
>
> * Writing working code (passes all edge cases)
> * Clean modular code
> * Talking through your approach

---

### ✅ Round 3: **Backend + Low-Level System Design (60 mins)**

* Format: 1-on-1 technical interview
* Topics:

  * API design (CRUD, pagination, status codes, versioning)
  * JWT auth flow
  * Node.js internals (event loop, async, streams)
  * MongoDB design or basic SQL
  * Caching (Redis), rate limiting, file uploads, queues (overview)

**You may be asked to:**

* Design a simple e-commerce checkout API
* Explain how to build a login + token refresh flow
* Implement retry logic for failed tasks
* Design a background job processor

> ✅ *Tip*: Think in **layers**: controller → service → DB/cache/queue
> Use diagrams or explain clearly if whiteboarding is not possible.

---

### ✅ Round 4: **Hiring Manager + Project Discussion (45–60 mins)**

* Evaluates:

  * Project depth: What did *you* build vs your team?
  * System thinking: performance, failures, DB issues
  * Ownership, debugging, learning attitude

**They may ask**:

* “What was the biggest challenge in your last project?”
* “How did you optimize a slow API?”
* “What trade-offs did you make under tight deadlines?”

> ✅ *Tip*: Use STAR format: **Situation–Task–Action–Result**

## 📚 Prep Checklist (1–2 weeks plan)

### 🔹 DSA

* ✅ Arrays, HashMaps, Strings
* ✅ 1–2 LeetCode mediums daily
* ✅ Topics: Sliding window, recursion, prefix sum, sorting

### 🔹 Node.js

* ✅ Event loop & async patterns (video + diagram)
* ✅ Middleware chain (write a mini Express clone)
* ✅ Auth with JWT (access + refresh)
* ✅ REST API + file uploads + error handling

### 🔹 System Design (for SDE-1 level)

* ✅ Design a login system
* ✅ Build a rate limiter
* ✅ Use Redis for caching

---

## 🎯 Final Pro Tips

* Be ready to code live & explain while coding.
* Clarify requirements before starting any design or coding.
* When stuck, talk through your thought process — they assess *how you think*.
* Prepare 1–2 solid past projects to talk about in detail (tech stack, scaling, bugs fixed, performance wins).
* Practice a 90-second crisp intro: Who you are, what you've built, and what you’re excited to solve.
