Not exactly 🙂 — let me clear this up.

When you write:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("outer " + i);

    for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        console.log("inner " + i);
    }
}
```

You **cannot access the outer `i` inside the inner loop** because:

* The inner `for (let i...)` **creates a new `i`** that shadows (hides) the outer one.
* Inside the inner loop block, the "outer `i`" is invisible because it’s shadowed by the new `i`.

---

### Example:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log("outer " + i);

    for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        console.log("inner " + i);
        // console.log("outer from inner " + i); ❌ this still refers to inner i
    }
}
```

If you want to access the **outer `i` inside the inner loop**, you must **use a different name** for the inner loop variable:

```js
for (let outer = 0; outer < 3; outer++) {
    console.log("outer " + outer);

    for (let inner = 0; inner < 2; inner++) {
        console.log("inner " + inner + " (outer is still " + outer + ")");
    }
}
```

✅ Output:

```
outer 0
inner 0 (outer is still 0)
inner 1 (outer is still 0)
outer 1
inner 0 (outer is still 1)
inner 1 (outer is still 1)
outer 2
inner 0 (outer is still 2)
inner 1 (outer is still 2)
```

👉 So to summarize:

* Outer `i` is indeed block scoped.
* But if you redeclare `let i` in the inner block, that **shadows** the outer one.
* If you need both, use different variable names.

Great question 👍 — the rules are **different in Java** compared to JavaScript.

Let’s compare.

### Java Example

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("outer " + i);

            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {  // ❌ ERROR in Java
                System.out.println("inner " + i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

👉 This will **NOT compile** in Java.
The compiler error would be something like:

```
variable i is already defined in method main(String[])
```

---

### Why?

* In Java, the scope rules are **stricter** than in JavaScript.
* Even though each `for` loop has its own block, **you cannot redeclare a variable with the same name inside an inner block if it was already declared in an outer block of the same method**.
* So the second `int i` conflicts with the outer `i`.

---

### Correct Java Version

If you want to access the outer index inside the inner loop, you must **use different variable names**:

```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int outer = 0; outer < 3; outer++) {
            System.out.println("outer " + outer);

            for (int inner = 0; inner < 2; inner++) {
                System.out.println("inner " + inner + " (outer is still " + outer + ")");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

✅ Output:

```
outer 0
inner 0 (outer is still 0)
inner 1 (outer is still 0)
outer 1
inner 0 (outer is still 1)
inner 1 (outer is still 1)
outer 2
inner 0 (outer is still 2)
inner 1 (outer is still 2)
```

👉 So the key difference is:

* **JavaScript (`let`)** → allows redeclaration in nested blocks (shadowing).
* **Java** → does **not** allow redeclaration of the same variable name inside nested blocks of the same method.

Would you like me to also explain *why Java forbids this* (the design reasoning behind not allowing shadowing in inner blocks)?
