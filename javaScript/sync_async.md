‚úÖ **Great question. Let's answer it clearly and precisely:**

---

### üëâ Line:

```js
let a = Promise.resolve(1);
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Answer: This line is **synchronous**.**

> It **immediately** creates a resolved promise. No waiting, no delay.

---

### üîç Detailed Explanation:

* `Promise.resolve(1)` is a **synchronous function call** that **returns a Promise object instantly** in the fulfilled state.
* It **does NOT execute any async behavior at this point**.

> Think of it as:
> ‚ÄúJust creating a box that says: ‚ÄòI already have the value 1‚Äô. I‚Äôm handing you that box right now.‚Äù

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What **is asynchronous**?

Only the **`.then()` callback** you attach to that promise is **asynchronous** ‚Äî because it's scheduled to run **after** the current synchronous code finishes.

---

### ‚úÖ Example to prove it:

```js
let a = Promise.resolve(1);
console.log("Before then");
console.log(a); // This prints immediately
a.then((v) => console.log("Resolved value:", v));
console.log("After then");
```

**Output:**

```
Before then
Promise {<fulfilled>: 1}
After then
Resolved value: 1
```

* `Promise.resolve(1)` ‚Üí sync
* `.then(...)` ‚Üí async

### üìå Summary:

| Statement            | Sync / Async   | Notes                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.resolve(1)` | ‚úÖ Synchronous  | Instantly returns a resolved promise  |
| `.then(() => ...)`   | ‚ùó Asynchronous | Callback runs later (microtask queue) |
