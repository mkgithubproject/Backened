✅ **Great question. Let's answer it clearly and precisely:**

---

### 👉 Line:

```js
let a = Promise.resolve(1);
```

---

### ✅ **Answer: This line is **synchronous**.**

> It **immediately** creates a resolved promise. No waiting, no delay.

---

### 🔍 Detailed Explanation:

* `Promise.resolve(1)` is a **synchronous function call** that **returns a Promise object instantly** in the fulfilled state.
* It **does NOT execute any async behavior at this point**.

> Think of it as:
> “Just creating a box that says: ‘I already have the value 1’. I’m handing you that box right now.”

---

### ⚠️ What **is asynchronous**?

Only the **`.then()` callback** you attach to that promise is **asynchronous** — because it's scheduled to run **after** the current synchronous code finishes.

---

### ✅ Example to prove it:

```js
let a = Promise.resolve(1);
console.log("Before then");
console.log(a); // This prints immediately
a.then((v) => console.log("Resolved value:", v));
console.log("After then");
```

**Output:**

```
Before then
Promise {<fulfilled>: 1}
After then
Resolved value: 1
```

* `Promise.resolve(1)` → sync
* `.then(...)` → async

### 📌 Summary:

| Statement            | Sync / Async   | Notes                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Promise.resolve(1)` | ✅ Synchronous  | Instantly returns a resolved promise  |
| `.then(() => ...)`   | ❗ Asynchronous | Callback runs later (microtask queue) |

Perfect! Async vs Sync is a **hot interview topic**, especially for **JavaScript backend/front-end roles**. Interviewers love asking tricky questions that **look simple** but test your deep understanding of the **event loop**, **microtasks**, and **timing**.

## 🔥 Top **Tricky Interview Questions** on Async vs Sync

### ✅ Format:

* Question
* Options (if applicable)
* Your expected answer
* Detailed explanation

---

### 1. **Trick Order Question – Microtask vs Macrotask**

```js
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("C");
});

console.log("D");
```

**Q: What is the output?**

---

### ✅ Output:

```
A
D
C
B
```

### 💡 Why?

* `console.log("A")` → sync
* `setTimeout(..., 0)` → macrotask → delayed
* `Promise.then(...)` → microtask → runs after sync
* `console.log("D")` → sync
* Then: microtask → `C`
* Then: macrotask → `B`

---

### 2. **Is `Promise.resolve().then(...)` sync or async?**

**Q: What type of task is `.then()` callback:**

* [ ] Synchronous
* [x] Asynchronous (Microtask)
* [ ] Macrotask

✅ **Answer:** Asynchronous — runs in the **microtask queue** after the call stack is clear.

---

### 3. **Async/Await Inside vs Outside**

```js
async function foo() {
  console.log("1");
  await Promise.resolve();
  console.log("2");
}
foo();
console.log("3");
```

**Q: Output?**

---

### ✅ Output:

```
1
3
2
```

### 💡 Why?

* `foo()` runs and logs `1`
* `await` pauses function and schedules the rest as a **microtask**
* Meanwhile `console.log("3")` runs
* Then microtask `console.log("2")` runs

---

### 4. **Loop + Async Confusion**

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 0);
}
```

**Q: Output?**

---

### ✅ Output:

```
3
3
3
```

### 💡 Why?

* `var` is function-scoped, so `i` is shared across all callbacks.
* By the time `setTimeout` executes, `i = 3`.

🧠 **Fix: use `let` instead of `var`** to make `i` block-scoped:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 0);
}
// Output: 0 1 2
```

---

### 5. **Promise Inside setTimeout**

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  Promise.resolve().then(() => {
    console.log("A");
  });
  console.log("B");
}, 0);

console.log("C");
```

**Q: Output?**

---

### ✅ Output:

```
C
B
A
```

### 💡 Why?

* `setTimeout(...)` is a **macrotask**
* `console.log("C")` is sync
* Inside `setTimeout`:

  * `console.log("B")` → sync inside macrotask
  * `Promise.then(...)` → **microtask** inside that macrotask
* After `B`, `A` runs as microtask before next macrotask

| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Is `setTimeout(..., 0)` synchronous?                       | ❌ No, it's **asynchronous (macrotask)**    |
| Does `Promise.resolve()` run immediately?                  | ✅ Yes, it's **synchronous**                |
| Does `.then()` execute immediately after promise creation? | ❌ No, it's scheduled as **microtask**      |
| Which executes first: `setTimeout` or `.then()`?           | ✅ `.then()` (microtasks before macrotasks) |
| Are `async/await` functions synchronous?                   | ❌ No, they return Promises (async)         |
