## üìò JavaScript: Execution Context vs Scope vs Lexical Scope vs Closure

---

### üîπ 1. Execution Context

#### ‚û§ Definition:

An **Execution Context** is the environment in which JavaScript code runs. Every time code runs, it's inside an execution context.

#### ‚úÖ Types:

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** ‚Äì created by default when JS starts.
2. **Function Execution Context (FEC)** ‚Äì created every time a function is called.
3. **Eval Execution Context** ‚Äì from `eval()` (rarely used).

#### ‚úÖ Phases:

* **Creation Phase:**

  * Creates `Variable Object`, `Scope Chain`, and `this` binding.
  * Hoisting of functions and variables (`var`).
* **Execution Phase:**

  * Code runs line by line. Variables get assigned.

#### üß† Example:

```js
var x = 10;
function show() {
  var y = 20;
  console.log(x + y);
}
show();
```

### üîπ 2. Scope

#### ‚û§ Definition:

**Scope** determines variable visibility ‚Äî where a variable can be accessed.

In JavaScript, there are **five main types of scopes**, each defining how and where variables can be accessed:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Global Scope**

* Variables declared **outside any function or block**.
* Accessible **anywhere** in the code.

```js
let x = 10; // Global scope

function show() {
  console.log(x); // Accessible here
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Function Scope**

* Variables declared **inside a function** using `var`, `let`, or `const` are accessible **only within that function**.

```js
function test() {
  let a = 5; // Function scope
  console.log(a);
}
console.log(a); // ‚ùå Error: a is not defined
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **Block Scope**

* Introduced with `let` and `const` (not `var`).
* Any variable declared inside `{}` is **limited to that block**.

```js
if (true) {
  let msg = "hello"; // Block scope
}
console.log(msg); // ‚ùå Error
```

> `var` is **not block-scoped**, which often causes confusion.

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **Lexical Scope** (Static Scope)

* Scope defined by **where variables and functions are written** in the code.
* Functions have access to variables in their **outer lexical scope**.

```js
function outer() {
  let x = "outer";
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // Lexical access to x
  }
  inner();
}
```

> This is what enables **closures** in JavaScript.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **Module Scope** (in ES6 Modules)

* Each **ES6 module** has its **own scope**.
* Variables declared in a module aren't accessible in other modules unless **explicitly exported/imported**.

```js
// file1.js
let secret = "hidden"; // Module scope
export const visible = "shown";

// file2.js
import { visible } from './file1.js';
console.log(visible); // OK
console.log(secret);  // ‚ùå Error
```

---

### üß† Bonus: **Script Scope** (Browser-only)

* In browsers, `<script>` tags without `type="module"` share the **same global scope**.
* Variables declared in one `<script>` are accessible in another.

| Scope Type | Where it's used                  | Visibility                                 |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Global     | Outside all functions/blocks     | Everywhere                                 |
| Function   | Inside a function                | Only inside that function                  |
| Block      | Inside `{}` with `let`/`const`   | Only inside that block                     |
| Lexical    | Defined by source code structure | Functions access variables in outer scopes |
| Module     | Inside ES6 module files          | Only in the module unless exported         |

Let me know if you'd like a **visual scope chain diagram** or a quiz to test this understanding!

   

#### üß† Example:

```js
let a = 10;
function test() {
  let b = 20;
  if (true) {
    let c = 30;
    console.log(a, b, c); // All accessible
  }
  // console.log(c); // Error: c is block-scoped
}
```

### üîπ 3. Lexical Scope

#### ‚û§ Definition:

**Lexical Scope** means scope is determined by the position of code **in the source**. Inner functions have access to their outer scope.\

üîç So, Why "Lexical Scope"?\
Lexical scope means that scope is determined by the position of code in the source file ‚Äî i.e., where functions and blocks are written (at coding time), not where they are called (at runtime).

#### üß† Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let a = 'outer';
  function inner() {
    console.log(a);
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
```

---

### üîπ 4. Closures

#### ‚û§ Definition:
A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and accesses variables from the outer function.

A **closure** is created when a function "remembers" variables from its **lexical scope**, even after the outer function has finished.\
üß† Key Points:\
A closure gives you access to an outer function‚Äôs scope from an inner function.

Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.
#### üß† Example:

```js
function outer() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function inner() {
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
  }
}
const inc = outer();
inc(); // 1
inc(); // 2
```

#### üîÅ Closure Use Cases:

* Data privacy (private variables)
* Function factories
* Memoization / caching
* Event handlers

| Lexical Scope     | Scope based on code position           | At writing time                 | Inner functions access outer vars |
| Closure           | Function retains access to outer scope | When inner function is returned | Keeps outer variables alive       |
