## Custom MyPromise `.then()` Execution Flow (Line-by-Line)

### ‚úÖ Example Code

```js
new MyPromise((resolve, reject) => {
  console.log("1Ô∏è‚É£ Executor running");
  resolve("‚úÖ First value");
})
  .then((res) => {
    console.log("2Ô∏è‚É£ First then:", res);
    return "‚û°Ô∏è From first then";
  })
  .then((res2) => {
    console.log("3Ô∏è‚É£ Second then:", res2);
  });
```

### üìò Step-by-Step Execution

#### **Step 1: Promise Instantiation**

* `new MyPromise(...)` is called.
* Constructor runs:

  * Initializes `state = 'pending'`
  * `value = undefined`
  * Executes the `executor` function.
* Logs: `1Ô∏è‚É£ Executor running`
* Calls `resolve("‚úÖ First value")`

#### **Step 2: `resolve` is triggered**

* Updates `this.state = 'fulfilled'`
* Sets `this.value = '‚úÖ First value'`
* Executes any queued `onFulfilledCallbacks` (none yet).

#### **Step 3: First `.then()` is attached**

* Calls `then()` on the resolved promise.
* A new `MyPromise` is returned.
* Since `this.state === 'fulfilled'`, it schedules:

  ```js
  setTimeout(() => fulfilledHandler(this.value), 0);
  ```

#### **Step 4: First `fulfilledHandler` runs**

* Executes: `fulfilledHandler("‚úÖ First value")`
* Calls the user's `onFulfilled`:

  ```js
  console.log("2Ô∏è‚É£ First then:", res);
  return "‚û°Ô∏è From first then";
  ```
* Logs: `2Ô∏è‚É£ First then: ‚úÖ First value`
* Returns a non-promise value ‚Üí resolve next chained promise with `'‚û°Ô∏è From first then'`

#### **Step 5: Second `.then()` is attached**

* Called on promise already resolved with `'‚û°Ô∏è From first then'`
* Schedules its handler:

  ```js
  setTimeout(() => fulfilledHandler(this.value), 0);
  ```

#### **Step 6: Second `fulfilledHandler` runs**

* Executes: `fulfilledHandler("‚û°Ô∏è From first then")`
* Logs: `3Ô∏è‚É£ Second then: ‚û°Ô∏è From first then`

### üßæ Final Console Output:

```
1Ô∏è‚É£ Executor running
2Ô∏è‚É£ First then: ‚úÖ First value
3Ô∏è‚É£ Second then: ‚û°Ô∏è From first then
```

### üß† Key Concepts

| Concept              | Explanation                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `executor()`         | Runs immediately during instantiation             |
| `.then()`            | Always returns a **new** `MyPromise`              |
| `setTimeout(..., 0)` | Ensures async behavior per spec                   |
| Returned value       | If it's a promise, wait on it; else pass it along |
| Callback queues      | Stored during pending state, called on resolution |

### üß† Microtask Analogy (Simplified)

* JavaScript ensures `.then()` callbacks run *after* synchronous code, even if already fulfilled.
* You simulate this behavior using `setTimeout(..., 0)` to mimic microtasks.

Let me know if you want to add `.catch`, `.finally`, or error propagation!
