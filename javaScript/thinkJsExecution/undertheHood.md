That’s a **very smart and important** concern — let’s unpack it carefully.

---

## 🤔 Your question:

> If **promises** and **async/await** are non-blocking, but still execute in the **main thread**, then what’s the real use of them?

---

## ✅ Short Answer:

Yes — **Promises run in the main thread**, but their real power is that they **don't block** the main thread while **waiting for slower operations** like:

* File I/O (in Node.js)
* Network requests
* Timers (`setTimeout`)
* IndexedDB / Web APIs

Instead, **JS keeps doing other things** while it waits for the result.

---

## 🔍 Let's go deeper: The Execution Model

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning:

```js
console.log("A");
slowOperation();
console.log("B");
```

If `slowOperation()` blocks for 2 seconds, JS **cannot do anything else** in that time. This is **bad** for performance.

---

## 🎯 With Async/Promises:

They allow **deferring work** without blocking the thread:

```js
console.log("A");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("B");
}, 2000);

console.log("C");

// Output:
// A
// C
// (after 2 sec)
// B
```

Here, `setTimeout` uses the browser/Node.js **Web APIs** or **libuv thread pool**, and the callback runs **later**, via the **event loop**.

Same with **promises**:

```js
console.log("Start");

fetch('https://api.example.com')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log("Data:", data));

console.log("End");

// Output:
// Start
// End
// (Then, when response comes back)
// Data: { ... }
```

---

## 🧠 Key Concept: **Non-blocking ≠ Multi-threading**

* JS doesn’t use multiple threads for JS execution (unless you use **Web Workers**).
* But async code (via **event loop**) lets **I/O run in the background**.

---

## ⚙️ Real World: Node.js Example

```js
const fs = require("fs");

console.log("Reading file...");

fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  console.log("File content:", data);
});

console.log("Doing other stuff...");
```

> `fs.readFile` runs in **libuv’s thread pool**, and lets the JS thread keep going.

---

## 🚫 What if you block the main thread?

```js
const fs = require("fs");

console.log("Reading file...");

const data = fs.readFileSync("file.txt", "utf8");

console.log("File content:", data);
```

This blocks the thread — nothing else can happen in between.

---

## 🔁 So, What’s the **use** of async/promises?

✅ Don’t block UI or server

✅ Can handle **multiple requests at once** (especially in Node.js)

✅ Make your app feel **faster and responsive**

---

## 🧪 Analogy:

> Imagine you're ordering food at a restaurant.

* **Blocking**: You stand at the counter until your food is ready — no one else can order.
* **Non-blocking**: You place your order, sit down, and wait — others can order too.

---

If you'd like, I can show how Node.js handles this internally using the **event loop + libuv** — or how browser Web APIs work with the **microtask queue (Promises)** and **task queue (Timers/DOM events)**.

Would you like to go into that level?
