Here’s a clear breakdown of the **advantages of using Express.js over raw Node.js**:

---

### 🔍 **1. Simpler Routing System**

**Node.js:** You have to manually parse URLs and HTTP methods.

```js
// Node.js
if (req.url === '/users' && req.method === 'GET') {
  // handle logic
}
```

**Express.js:**

````js
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // much cleaner
});
``>✅ *Advantage: Cleaner and more readable routing.*

---

### ⚙️ **2. Middleware Support**
**Node.js:** You have to write all logic (like logging, body parsing, authentication) from scratch.

**Express.js:** Built-in and third-party middleware (e.g., `body-parser`, `morgan`) are easily pluggable.
```js
app.use(express.json());  // parses JSON body automatically
````

> ✅ *Advantage: Modular, pluggable request processing.*

---

### 📦 **3. Rapid Development**

**Express.js** has tons of utility functions and abstractions:

* `res.send()`, `res.json()`, `res.status()`
* Static file serving with `express.static()`
* Routing with parameters: `/users/:id`

> ✅ *Advantage: Speeds up development and reduces boilerplate.*

---

### 🔐 **4. Easy Integration with Template Engines**

Express supports view engines like:

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Node.js requires manual setup for templating.

> ✅ *Advantage: Simplified rendering of dynamic HTML pages.*

---

### 🧩 **5. Robust Ecosystem**

Express has a large ecosystem of middleware and tools:

* Authentication (`passport`)
* Validation (`express-validator`)
* Logging (`morgan`)

> ✅ *Advantage: Reuse well-tested modules instead of reinventing the wheel.*

---

### 🧼 **6. Clean Code Structure**

Express promotes MVC architecture:

```
routes/
controllers/
models/
```

Node.js with only core HTTP module can become messy for large apps.

> ✅ *Advantage: Scalable and maintainable code structure.*

| Feature                   | Node.js (http module) | Express.js                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Routing                   | Manual                | Declarative, simple          |
| Middleware                | Manual logic          | Built-in support             |
| Request/Response Handling | Verbose               | Utility methods (`res.send`) |
| Static File Serving       | Manual setup          | `express.static()`           |
| Templating                | Manual integration    | One-line setup               |
| Development Speed         | Slower                | Faster                       |
| Community & Middleware    | Small                 | Huge                         |

If you're building a small, experimental server — Node.js is fine.

But for real-world apps — **Express.js is the standard choice** due to its simplicity, structure, and ecosystem.
