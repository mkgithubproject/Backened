Great question!

## 🧠 What is REPL?

**REPL** stands for:

> **R**ead – **E**val – **P**rint – **L**oop

It’s an **interactive programming environment** — like a live playground — where you can type code and see the result immediately.

---

## 🔍 Deep Dive: What Does REPL Mean?

### 1. **Read**

The REPL **reads** the user’s input — a single JavaScript expression, command, or line of code — and parses it into an internal data structure (like an Abstract Syntax Tree).

👉 Example:

```js
> 2 + 2
```

This input is read and prepared for evaluation.

---

### 2. **Eval (Evaluate)**

The REPL then **evaluates** the parsed code. It runs the JavaScript logic using the V8 engine (in Node.js).

👉 Example:

```js
> 2 + 2
```

This gets evaluated to `4`.

---

### 3. **Print**

Next, REPL **prints** the result of the evaluation back to the screen.

👉 Output:

```bash
4
```

---

### 4. **Loop**

The REPL then **loops** back, waiting for the next user input — and the cycle continues.

👉 You can keep typing more commands:

```js
> const name = 'Mohit';
undefined
> name.toUpperCase();
'MOHIT'
```

## 🟢 Node.js REPL

In Node.js, the REPL lets you:

* Run JavaScript commands line by line
* Test small code snippets
* Inspect variables
* Interact with `process.env`, modules, functions, etc.

---

### ✅ How to enter Node.js REPL

In your terminal, type:

```bash
node
```

You’ll see something like:

```
Welcome to Node.js v18.x.x
Type ".help" for more information.
>
```

Now you can type JavaScript directly:

```js
> 2 + 2
4

> const x = 10
undefined

> x * 3
30

> process.env.PATH
'/usr/local/bin:...'
```

To exit the REPL:

```bash
> .exit
```

Or press `Ctrl + C` twice.

---

## 🧪 Why Use REPL?

* Quickly test a function or logic
* Explore the behavior of JavaScript features
* Debug simple issues without writing a file

---

## 🛠️ Example Use Case

```bash
$ node
```

```js
> const greet = name => `Hello, ${name}`;
> greet('Mohit')
'Hello, Mohit'
```
