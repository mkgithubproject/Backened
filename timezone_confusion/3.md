Very good 🔥 this is the exact confusion point.
Let’s break it slowly and clearly.

You said:

```js
console.log(new Date("2026/03/02"))
```

And you see:

```
2026-03-01T15:00:00.000Z
```

Now you are asking:

> What is stored internally in memory? What happened?

---

# ✅ Step 1 — What you passed

You passed:

```
"2026/03/02"
```

Important:

⚠ This string has **NO timezone**
⚠ This is NOT UTC
⚠ This is interpreted as **local time**

So JavaScript assumes:

> 2026 March 2 at 00:00 in YOUR SYSTEM TIMEZONE

If your system is Japan (UTC+9):

It becomes:

```
2026-03-02 00:00 JST
```

---

# ✅ Step 2 — What JavaScript stores internally

JavaScript does NOT store:

* "2026/03/02"
* "JST"
* "UTC"

It stores:

```
Milliseconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00 UTC
```

So it converts your local time to UTC first.

Japan is UTC+9.

So:

```
2026-03-02 00:00 JST
- 9 hours
=
2026-03-01 15:00 UTC
```

THAT is what gets stored internally.

So memory actually contains:

```
2026-03-01T15:00:00.000Z
```

✔ That is correct
✔ That is expected
✔ Nothing is changing randomly

---

# 🔎 Visual Timeline

You typed:

```
2026/03/02
```

JS thinks:

```
2026-03-02 00:00 (local time JST)
```

Convert to UTC:

```
2026-03-01 15:00 UTC
```

Store in memory:

```
Epoch milliseconds for 2026-03-01T15:00:00Z
```

When you do:

```js
d.toISOString()
```

You see:

```
2026-03-01T15:00:00.000Z
```

When you do:

```js
console.log(d)
```

You see:

```
Mon Mar 02 2026 00:00:00 GMT+0900
```

Same moment.
Different display format.

# 🧠 Most Important Rule

JavaScript Date always stores time in UTC internally.

But:

| Input Type               | How JS Interprets It |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `"2026-03-01T15:00:00Z"` | Already UTC          |
| `"2026-03-02"`           | Local timezone       |
| `"2026/03/02"`           | Local timezone       |

---

# 🚨 Why This Causes Problems

If you store only a date like:

```
2026/03/02
```

It becomes midnight in local time.

If your backend/server timezone changes:

The UTC value changes.

This causes date shifting bugs.

---

# 🎯 Clean Mental Model

Think like this:

> Date object = UTC timestamp
> Input without timezone = assumed local
> Display depends on method

---

If you want, I can now show:

* How to store pure dates safely (no shifting)
* Why `"YYYY-MM-DD"` behaves differently from `"YYYY/MM/DD"`
* How to fix this in Node + PostgreSQL production system

This is a very important backend concept.
