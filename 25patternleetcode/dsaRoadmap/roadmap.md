Here’s a complete **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning path** designed for absolute clarity, from beginner to advanced level — ideal if you're preparing for interviews, competitive programming, or general CS mastery.

---

### 🧱 **Step 1: Prerequisites**

Before diving into DSA, make sure you’re comfortable with:

* Basic programming (loops, functions, arrays, conditionals)
* A language of choice: **Java**, **Python**, **C++**, or **JavaScript**
* Basic time & space complexity concepts (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`)

---

### 🌱 **Step 2: Core Data Structures**

#### 📦 Arrays & Strings

* Static and dynamic arrays
* 2D arrays
* Sliding window
* Prefix sum
* String manipulation techniques

#### 🐍 Linked List

* Singly, Doubly, Circular
* Fast & slow pointer techniques
* Reversals, Palindrome check

#### 🗃️ Stack & Queue

* Stack using arrays/linked lists
* Queue using arrays/linked lists
* Circular queue
* Deque (double-ended queue)
* Monotonic Stack/Queue

#### 🧭 Hashing

* HashMap / HashSet
* Frequency maps
* Count of elements, grouping anagrams, etc.

---

### 🌳 **Step 3: Tree-Based Data Structures**

#### Binary Trees

* Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level order
* Diameter of tree
* Height, Leaf nodes, Sum paths

#### Binary Search Tree (BST)

* Insert, Delete, Search
* Floor, Ceil, Kth smallest/largest
* Validate BST

#### Advanced Trees

* AVL Tree (basics)
* Trie (prefix tree)
* Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)

---

### 🧩 **Step 4: Recursion + Backtracking**

* Base case, recursive case
* Subset, Permutation, Combination problems
* Sudoku solver
* N-Queens
* Rat in a Maze

---

### 📐 **Step 5: Sorting Algorithms**

* Bubble, Insertion, Selection Sort
* Merge Sort (Divide & Conquer)
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Count Sort / Radix Sort

Also learn:

* **Stable vs Unstable Sort**
* **In-place vs Non-in-place Sort**

---

### 🔍 **Step 6: Searching Algorithms**

* Linear & Binary Search
* Lower bound, upper bound
* Binary search in rotated array
* Search in 2D matrix
* Ternary Search

---

### 🚦 **Step 7: Binary Search on Answer**

* Koko Eating Bananas
* Minimum Days to Make Bouquets
* Allocate Books

---

### 🧠 **Step 8: Dynamic Programming (DP)**

**1D DP**

* Fibonacci
* Climbing Stairs
* House Robber

**2D DP**

* Knapsack variants (0/1, unbounded)
* Grid-based (Unique Paths, Min Path Sum)
* Subsequence-based (LCS, LIS, Edit Distance)

**DP on Trees & DP on Subsets**

---

### 🧭 **Step 9: Graphs**

* Representation: Adjacency List/Matrix
* BFS, DFS
* Topological Sort
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm
* Prim’s & Kruskal’s MST
* Union-Find / DSU
* Cycle detection
* Flood fill, Connected components

---

### 🧪 **Step 10: Advanced Topics**

* Sliding Window Maximum / Median
* Monotonic Stack problems
* Greedy algorithms
* Bit Manipulation
* Heap / Priority Queue
* Two pointers / Fast-slow pointers
* Meet in the middle

---


* **Strategy**:

  * Start easy, then medium, then hard
  * Solve problems in **patterns** (e.g., sliding window, binary search)
  * Practice daily (consistency > intensity)
