## 🛣️ DSA Roadmap: From Scratch to Advanced

---

### ✅ **Stage 1: Prerequisites (Programming Basics)**

Before diving into DSA, ensure you’re comfortable with:

* **A programming language** (Java, C++, Python — choose one)
* Basic syntax, loops, functions, recursion, arrays
* **OOPs concepts**: classes, inheritance, polymorphism (for Java/C++)

📘 Recommended:

* Java: [Java Notes for Beginners](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* C++: [Learn C++](https://www.learncpp.com/)
* Python: [Python DSA](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

---

### 🔰 **Stage 2: Learn Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation)**

#### 📚 Topics:

* What is time/space complexity?
* Big O, Big Ω, Big Θ
* Common complexities: O(1), O(n), O(log n), O(n²), etc.
* Best, worst, average case

✅ Practice:

* Analyze loops
* Nested loops
* Recursion time complexity

---

### 📦 **Stage 3: Master Core Data Structures**

#### 1. **Arrays**

* Insertion, deletion, traversal
* Sliding window, prefix sum, 2D arrays

#### 2. **Strings**

* String manipulation
* Character frequency, anagram, palindrome
* KMP algorithm (advanced)

#### 3. **Linked Lists**

* Singly and doubly linked list
* Reversal, cycle detection (Floyd's algorithm)
* Merge two lists, middle of list

#### 4. **Stacks and Queues**

* Stack using array/LL
* Queue & Circular Queue
* Monotonic stack/queue
* Infix → Postfix (expression evaluation)

✅ Practice platform: [LeetCode Easy + Medium](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)

---

### 🧠 **Stage 4: Recursion & Backtracking**

#### 📚 Topics:

* Factorial, Fibonacci (basic)
* Backtracking: N-Queens, Sudoku, Maze problems
* Subsets, permutations, combinations

---

### 🌲 **Stage 5: Trees and Binary Trees**

#### 📚 Topics:

* Binary tree, BST, traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
* Height, diameter, mirror tree
* LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
* Balanced BST, AVL (intro)
* Serialization & Deserialization

✅ Practice:

* [Binary Tree Problems – LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)

---

### 📎 **Stage 6: Heaps and Priority Queues**

* Min-heap, Max-heap
* Heapify, build heap
* Kth largest/smallest element
* Priority Queue using heap

---

### 🔗 **Stage 7: Hashing**

* Hash Maps & Hash Sets
* Frequency maps, duplicates
* Two sum, subarrays with sum K
* Collision resolution (intro)

---

### 🧩 **Stage 8: Graphs (Core + Advanced)**

#### 📚 Topics:

* Representation (adjacency list/matrix)
* BFS, DFS (recursive + iterative)
* Topological sort (Kahn’s algorithm)
* Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall
* MST (Prim’s and Kruskal’s)
* Union-Find (DSU), cycle detection
* Graph coloring, bridges, articulation points

---

### 🧠 **Stage 9: Dynamic Programming (DP)**

#### 📚 Start with:

* Recursion → Memoization → Tabulation

#### 📦 Topics:

* 0/1 Knapsack
* Fibonacci variations
* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
* Matrix DP, DP on trees
* Bitmask DP (advanced)

---

### 🧮 **Stage 10: Bit Manipulation**

* AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left/right shift
* Check even/odd, count set bits
* Subsets using bits
* Bit tricks and optimizations

---

### 🔎 **Stage 11: Advanced Topics**

* **Segment Trees / Fenwick Tree (BIT)**
* **Tries** – for autocomplete, prefix search
* **Greedy algorithms** – activity selection, job scheduling
* **Sliding Window & Two Pointers** (Deep Dive)
* **Top Interview Questions**

---

### 🧪 **Stage 12: Problem Solving and Practice**

* **LeetCode**: Focus on 100 most popular questions
* **Codeforces / AtCoder**: For competitive programming
* **InterviewBit / GeeksforGeeks**: Topic-wise DSA
* **System Design Prep** (optional for 4+ yrs exp)
