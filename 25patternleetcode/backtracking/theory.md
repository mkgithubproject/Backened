Sure! Let‚Äôs break down **Backtracking** in a clear, beginner-friendly way, with step-by-step theory and **Java** examples.

## ‚úÖ What is Backtracking?

Backtracking is a **brute-force search algorithm** that tries out all possible solutions and **undoes (backtracks)** a choice if it doesn‚Äôt lead to a solution.

> It is used in problems where:

* You need to find all solutions (or one valid solution)
* Each step has multiple choices
* Some choices lead to dead ends

---

## ‚úÖ Steps of Backtracking

1. Choose a possible option.
2. Recur with that choice.
3. If the choice leads to a solution, return.
4. If it doesn‚Äôt, undo (backtrack) the choice and try another.

## üîÅ Backtracking Flow (Pseudocode)

```java
void backtrack(state) {
    if (goalReached(state)) {
        saveOrPrintSolution(state);
        return;
    }

    for (choice in allPossibleChoices) {
        if (isValid(choice, state)) {
            makeChoice(state, choice);
            backtrack(state);
            undoChoice(state, choice); // backtrack
        }
    }
}
```
