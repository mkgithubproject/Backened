Great question! Let's **deeply and clearly** explain why this happens:

---

## 🔄 You're Asking:

> If React re-renders the component, and the line says:
>
> ```js
> const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
> ```
>
> then **why doesn’t `count` become 0 again?**

---

## ✅ The Key Truth

**`useState(0)` only uses the `0` during the **first render**.**

On later renders, React **ignores the argument** and retrieves the value from its **internal memory (hook state store)** using the **hook call order**.

---

## 💡 Visual Explanation

### ✅ First Render

```js
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // 👈 used: 0
  // suppose we click a button -> setCount(1)
}
```

React internally:

```js
REACT_STATE_STORE = {
  Counter: {
    hooks: [0],   // index 0 = count
    hookIndex: 0,
  }
}
```

Then you click a button → `setCount(1)` → updates internal store:

```js
REACT_STATE_STORE = {
  Counter: {
    hooks: [1],   // count = 1 now
    hookIndex: 0,
  }
}
```

---

### 🔁 On Re-render

```js
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  // 👈 Looks like 0 is passed again
}
```

But **React says**:

> “This is the 1st hook call, and I already have a value stored at index 0 (`1`), so I will return that.”

So:

```js
[count, setCount] = [1, function to update hooks[0]]
```

Even though your code says `useState(0)`, React **ignores `0`** after the first time.

---

## 🧠 React Internals (simplified):

Here’s a pseudo-implementation of how React does this:

```js
let hookIndex = 0;
const hooks = [];

function useState(initialValue) {
  const currentIndex = hookIndex;

  // only on first render
  if (hooks[currentIndex] === undefined) {
    hooks[currentIndex] = initialValue;
  }

  const setState = (newValue) => {
    hooks[currentIndex] = newValue;
    rerender(); // simulate React re-rendering
  };

  hookIndex++;
  return [hooks[currentIndex], setState];
}
```

| Re-renders                    | React uses previously stored value, not the argument you passed again      |
| Hook identity                 | Tracked by **order of useState calls** (hook index)                        |
| `const count = useState(...)` | `count` is a new const every render with updated value from React's memory |

Excellent! You're asking:

> ❓ On re-render, how does React know which hook is at which index — how does `useState(1)` and `useState(2)` map correctly again?

Let’s go step-by-step into the **internals of how React manages hook call order and indexing** on each render.

---

## 🧠 The Key Concept: **Hook Index Tracking per Component**

Each time React renders a component:

1. It sets a `hookIndex = 0`
2. For **each hook call** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.), it:

   * Uses the current `hookIndex` to get/set state from an internal array (called the "hook state list")
   * Increments the `hookIndex` after each hook call

React relies on the **order in which hooks are called** to correctly link state to logic.

---

### ✅ First Render of `MyComponent`

```js
function MyComponent() {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);  // index 0
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);  // index 1
}
```

React does this internally:

```js
let hookIndex = 0;
hookStates[0] = 1;   // for a
hookIndex++;         // now 1
hookStates[1] = 2;   // for b
hookIndex++;         // now 2
```

---

### 🔁 Second Render (after setA(100))

React resets:

```js
hookIndex = 0;
```

Then `useState(1)` runs again but React does **not** use `1` anymore — it does:

```js
hookStates[0] // which is now 100
```

Then:

```js
hookIndex++;  // move to 1
hookStates[1] // still 2
```

So your values are:

```js
a === 100
b === 2
```

Even though `useState(1)` and `useState(2)` appear to be "reset", React ignores those values after first render.

---

## 🎯 Example with Output:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1);
  const [b, setB] = useState(2);
  console.log("a:", a, "b:", b);
}
```

### First Render:

```
hookStates = [1, 2]
console: a: 1, b: 2
```

### After setA(100), on re-render:

```
hookStates = [100, 2]
console: a: 100, b: 2
```

---

## ⚠️ Why Hook Order Matters

If you do something like this:

```js
if (someCondition) {
  const [a, setA] = useState(1); // bad!
}
```

Then the order of hook calls might change, and React will get **confused** — wrong hook value will be mapped to the wrong logic.

So React **strictly enforces** that:

* Hooks must always be called **in the same order**
* No `if`, `for`, `while` around hook calls

| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hook index                    | Starts at 0 on each render                                                 |
| Each `useState` call          | Uses `hookStates[hookIndex]`, then increments `hookIndex`                  |
| Initial value (`useState(1)`) | Only used if no value exists at that index (first render only)             |
| Re-render                     | Reuses `hookStates[index]` from previous render                            |
| Why this works                | Because **order is fixed**, React knows exactly which hook is being called |

---

You're asking a **very important question** — and you’re close to fully grasping how `useState` works internally!

Let's revisit the context:

```js
function useState(initialValue) {
  const currentIndex = hookIndex;

  if (componentFiber.isMount) {
    componentFiber.hookStates[currentIndex] = initialValue;
  }

  const setState = (newVal) => {
    componentFiber.hookStates[currentIndex] = newVal; // <-- you're asking about this line
    componentFiber.isMount = false;
    render(); // re-render the component
  };

  const value = componentFiber.hookStates[currentIndex];
  hookIndex++;
  return [value, setState];
}
```

---

## ❓ The Big Question:
> When `setState(newVal)` is called **later**, how does it know which index (`hookStates[currentIndex]`) to update?

---

### 🧠 Key Concept: **Closure Over `currentIndex`**

When you call `useState`, you're doing this:

```js
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Behind the scenes:
- `hookIndex = 0`
- `currentIndex = 0` is **captured** inside `setState`
- `setState` is **returned**, and **stored in your variable** (`setCount`)
- That `setState` has **closure** over `currentIndex = 0`

So even when you call `setCount(123)` **much later**, it still knows to update:

```js
hookStates[0] = 123
```

Because `setState` was **created with currentIndex = 0**, and closure keeps that value alive!

---

### ✅ Closure in Action (Simple Example)

```js
function makeSetter(index) {
  return function setState(newVal) {
    hookStates[index] = newVal;
  };
}

const setState0 = makeSetter(0);
const setState1 = makeSetter(1);

setState0(100); // updates hookStates[0]
setState1(200); // updates hookStates[1]
```

Each `setState` remembers its own index.

---

### 🧩 So in React:

Each time you do:

```js
const [a, setA] = useState(1);  // hookIndex = 0
const [b, setB] = useState(2);  // hookIndex = 1
```

React returns two `setState` functions:
- `setA()` → remembers index `0`
- `setB()` → remembers index `1`

And each one updates its specific slot in the `hookStates[]` array.

---

### 🧠 Visual Example

| Hook Call Order | `hookIndex` | State Slot       | `setState` Remembers |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| `useState(1)`    | 0           | `hookStates[0]`   | `currentIndex = 0`     |
| `useState(2)`    | 1           | `hookStates[1]`   | `currentIndex = 1`     |

So later:
```js
setA(100) --> updates hookStates[0]
setB(200) --> updates hookStates[1]
```

---

|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `currentIndex`         | Captured when `useState()` is called                                        |

| Hook tracking          | Order of `useState` calls determines `currentIndex`                         |
| Why this works         | Because `setState` is **created once**, with `currentIndex` **locked in**   |

---

Good question 👍 Let’s break it down.

In React, **`setState` (or `useState` setters)** works **asynchronous + batched** inside React event handlers.

---

### Case 1: Inside the same synchronous event handler

If you call `setState` **three times in a row** inside the same function:

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

👉 What happens?

* React batches all three updates because they happen in the same event.
* Each one uses the **stale value of `count` (0)**.
* Final state = `0 + 1 = 1`.
* UI updates **once**, not three times.

---

### Case 2: Using functional updates

If you want it to truly increment 3 times:

```jsx
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
setCount(prev => prev + 1);
```

👉 Now React applies them sequentially:

* Start: `0`
* After 1st: `1`
* After 2nd: `2`
* After 3rd: `3`
* UI updates **once**, final value = `3`.

---

### Case 3: Different async contexts

If `setState` is called in **different async callbacks** (like `setTimeout`, `fetch`, etc.), React won’t batch them together:

```jsx
setTimeout(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 0);
setTimeout(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 0);
setTimeout(() => setCount(c => c + 1), 0);
```

👉 Each executes separately.
UI will update **three times**, ending at `3`.

---

✅ **Summary**

* Inside one sync event → batched, only last value or functional updates matter.
* Using functional updates → you can accumulate changes properly.
* Across async boundaries → React applies them separately.

Do you want me to also show a **dry-run diagram** of what happens in memory when React batches vs functional updates?
