## üî• Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

| Feature               | **Monolithic Architecture**                                                                         | **Microservices Architecture**                                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**        | A single, unified application where all components are tightly coupled and run as a single service. | An application built as a suite of small, independent services that communicate over the network. |
| **Codebase**          | Single codebase for the whole app.                                                                  | Multiple codebases for each service.                                                              |
| **Deployment**        | Entire app is deployed as one unit.                                                                 | Each service can be deployed independently.                                                       |
| **Scaling**           | Scale the whole app, even if only one part needs it.                                                | Scale only the service that needs more resources.                                                 |
| **Development Speed** | Fast to start but becomes harder to manage over time.                                               | Slower to start but scales better with teams.                                                     |
| **Tech Stack**        | Typically one language/framework.                                                                   | Each service can use a different language/framework.                                              |
| **Failure Impact**    | One failure can crash the whole app.                                                                | Failures are isolated to specific services.                                                       |
| **Testing**           | Easier to write end-to-end tests.                                                                   | Testing requires service mocks or integration setups.                                             |
| **Communication**     | Internal function calls.                                                                            | Over HTTP (REST/gRPC) or messaging queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ).                                       |
| **Best For**          | Small to medium apps, MVPs, early-stage startups.                                                   | Large-scale apps with many teams or complex domains.                                              |

## ‚úÖ Example

### Monolithic:

```text
A single Node.js app:
- /users
- /orders
- /products
All in one codebase, deployed as one app.
```

### Microservices:

```text
Separate services:
- user-service (Node.js + MongoDB)
- order-service (Python + PostgreSQL)
- product-service (Go + MySQL)

Each deployed independently via Docker/Kubernetes.
```

## üì¶ Use Case Scenarios

| Use Case                                         | Best Fit        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Early-stage startup with small team              | ‚úÖ Monolith      |
| App expected to grow rapidly with multiple teams | ‚úÖ Microservices |
| MVP needing quick delivery                       | ‚úÖ Monolith      |
| Fintech, e-commerce, streaming platform          | ‚úÖ Microservices |
| App with shared data models and tight coupling   | ‚úÖ Monolith      |

## üõ†Ô∏è When to Choose What?

### Choose **Monolith** if:

* You're just starting out.
* You have a small dev team.
* You need quick time-to-market.
* Your app is simple or small.

### Choose **Microservices** if:

* You have a large team or multiple teams.
