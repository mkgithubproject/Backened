Great! Below are **mock answers** (in STAR format) for the **top 10 Infosys managerial round questions**, tailored for a **Node.js backend developer with 2.5 years of experience**.

---

### ✅ 1. **Can you walk me through your most recent project? What was your role?**

**S:** I worked on an e-commerce platform handling user orders, payments, and inventory using Node.js and MongoDB.
**T:** My task was to develop and maintain microservices for order management and integrate Razorpay for payments.
**A:** I designed REST APIs, wrote unit tests, and optimized MongoDB queries for faster reads. I also worked with Redis for caching frequent queries.
**R:** This reduced average API response time by 40%, and the new payment flow led to a 15% increase in successful transactions.

---

### ✅ 2. **What challenges did you face in your Node.js project and how did you overcome them?**

**S:** We had a challenge where the server slowed down under high traffic during a festival sale.
**T:** My goal was to identify and fix the bottleneck without downtime.
**A:** I used tools like PM2, New Relic, and manual logging to track memory leaks and found that some DB queries weren’t indexed. I added proper indexing and moved some logic to background workers using BullJS.
**R:** We handled 3x more traffic with stable performance and zero downtime.

---

### ✅ 3. **How do you ensure code quality in your team?**

**S:** We were a team of 4 backend developers working on a time-sensitive product launch.
**T:** My responsibility was to make sure all code was maintainable and scalable.
**A:** I followed best practices: used ESLint, enforced PR reviews, wrote unit tests using Jest, and added Swagger documentation for every new endpoint.
**R:** Our team had <3% rollback rate on deployments and onboarded new devs 2x faster due to consistent code.

---

### ✅ 4. **Have you ever suggested a new tool or approach in your project?**

**S:** Our team manually tested APIs which was slow and error-prone.
**T:** I wanted to improve testing coverage and reduce manual effort.
**A:** I proposed and integrated Postman tests into our CI pipeline using Newman, and introduced Jest for unit testing.
**R:** This saved 3–4 hours per sprint and increased test coverage from 45% to 85%.

---

### ✅ 5. **Have you worked on production issues? Can you explain a critical bug you solved?**

**S:** Once, users were unable to place orders intermittently during peak time.
**T:** My role was to debug and resolve the issue ASAP.
**A:** I traced logs and found that an external payment API call was timing out. I implemented retries with exponential backoff and added proper timeout/error handling.
**R:** This fixed the issue permanently and reduced failed transactions by 80%.

---

### ✅ 6. **Have you mentored any junior developers or helped your peers?**

**S:** A junior dev was struggling with understanding middleware flow in Express.js.
**T:** I decided to mentor him for a few days to improve his productivity.
**A:** I created a simple example project explaining middleware execution and walked him through it. Also introduced pair programming sessions.
**R:** He became more confident and contributed a new feature independently within a week.

---

### ✅ 7. **How do you handle disagreements in a team?**

**S:** We had a disagreement about using GraphQL vs REST for a new feature.
**T:** I wanted to ensure we made a decision based on facts, not opinions.
**A:** I facilitated a short team meeting, listed pros and cons, did a quick performance comparison, and involved the lead in the final decision.
**R:** We stuck with REST for consistency and added GraphQL only for specific new features.

---

### ✅ 8. **Tell me about a time you missed a deadline. How did you handle it?**

**S:** I was once responsible for integrating a third-party service, but their API documentation was outdated.
**T:** I had to finish the integration in 3 days, but delays in understanding their API caused a setback.
**A:** I informed my manager early, suggested adjusting the sprint scope, and worked late to finish it with proper error handling.
**R:** We delivered the integration in 4 days instead of 3, but with complete testing and fewer bugs.

---

### ✅ 9. **How do you communicate progress and blockers to your lead or manager?**

**S:** Our team followed 2-week sprints with daily standups.
**T:** I had to keep my manager informed about a feature that was stuck due to an external API delay.
**A:** I clearly shared progress in stand-ups, updated Jira tickets, and wrote blockers in a shared doc. I also proactively suggested alternatives.
**R:** This helped the manager escalate the issue with the vendor and saved us from idle waiting.

---

### ✅ 10. **How do you work with frontend or DevOps teams during integration?**

**S:** I worked on a feature requiring frontend and DevOps coordination (S3 image uploads + Nginx routing).
**T:** I needed to ensure seamless handoff to frontend and proper routing in staging.
**A:** I created Postman docs and shared Swagger API schemas. Worked with DevOps to whitelist S3 buckets and test uploads in staging before prod.
**R:** The feature was deployed smoothly without regression, and all teams were aligned.
